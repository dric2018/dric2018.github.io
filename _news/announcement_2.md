Together with colleagues from IFC's Country Advisory and Economics team, I attended the [#GAISA2025](https://c4ir.rw/global-ai-summit-on-africa). See below.

The Global AI Summit on Africa, held in Kigali, Rwanda, marked a historic moment for the continent's digital and technological future. Delegates from around the globe including policymakers, tech leaders, innovators, and youth gathered to shape a shared vision for Africa‚Äôs role in the global AI ecosystem.

A standout announcement came from **Cassava Technologies and NVIDIA**, who revealed a strategic partnership to build Africa‚Äôs first large-scale **AI Factory**. Starting with 3,000 GPUs in South Africa and expanding to Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, and Egypt, this initiative aims to bridge Africa‚Äôs compute gap and enable the training of AI models locally, using African data for African needs.

Throughout the summit, speakers emphasized that Africa no longer needs more strategies‚Äîit needs action. Leaders and stakeholders highlighted the urgent need for:

- **Accessible compute infrastructure** (GPUs, data centers, reliable power and connectivity)  
- **Coordinated AI policy and regulation** across borders  
- **Focused investment in talent, data governance, and innovation ecosystems**

There was strong consensus that advancing Africa's AI capabilities requires **continental collaboration**, **shared infrastructure**, and **clear accountability**. From ministers and tech CEOs to grassroots innovators, the message was clear: Africa must lead its own AI transformation, not just adapt to global trends.

### Key Takeaways
- üåê 54 nations endorsed the **Africa Declaration on AI**
- üß† **Africa AI Council** created to oversee governance and implementation
- üí∞ Launch of a **$60B Africa-AI Fund**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Cassava‚ÄìNVIDIA AI Factory** to boost local compute power across 5 countries
- üì¢ Calls for **actions over strategies**‚Äîwith infrastructure, policy, and innovation as top priorities

The summit was concluded with the [Africa Declaration on AI](/assets/pdf/Africa_declaration.pdf), endorsed by all African countries. The declaration sets a bold continental agenda for ethical, inclusive, and sovereign AI development. It aligns with frameworks like Agenda 2063 and AfCFTA and introduces the **Africa AI Council**, a continental governance body to oversee coordination and implementation. It also pledged a **$60 billion Africa-AI Fund** to support infrastructure, talent development, and data governance across the continent.

This Summit solidified Africa‚Äôs voice in global AI discourse and signaled a clear shift: from fragmented efforts to a unified, action-driven approach for inclusive AI development across the continent.
