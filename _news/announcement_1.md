Earlier this year, Côte d’Ivoire’s Ministry of Digital Transition and Digitalization (MTND) reached a key milestone: presenting the final drafts of both its **Data Governance Strategy (SNGD 2030)** and **National AI Strategy (SNIA 2030)** to Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé for government adoption and rollout.

On **March 13, 2025**, the MTND officially handed the two strategies to the Prime Minister. This followed several months of intensive preparation under the umbrella of the Côte d'Ivoire digital acceleration project (CIDAP) supported by the World Bank.

### Strategy Highlights  

- **SNGD 2030 (Data Governance Strategy)**  
  - Comprehensive inventory of broadband and data infrastructure, legal/regulatory mapping, and plans to enhance digital trust and interoperability.

- **SNIA 2030 (National AI Strategy)**  
  Built upon three strategic pillars:  
  1. **Investment (in infrastructure & skills)** – launching data centers, sovereign cloud systems, and AI labs.  
  2. **Inclusion** – ensuring equitable access across regions and demographics.  
  3. **Governance** – creating ethical frameworks, a “Safe AI” label, and a national oversight committee.

These strategies complement PARAE's goals to digitize public administration, boost interoperability, enhance cybersecurity, and build a green data center—all part of the $80 million AfDB-sponsored initiative to modernize governance.

The planned actions during the implementation period include:
- Establishing a **National Committee for AI & Data Governance**, set to steer implementation.  
- Building a domestic **AI hub** with startup incubator and training center.  
- Launching a **“Safe AI” certification** to ensure trust and ethics in AI applications.  
- Creating a **mapping of digital assets and expertise** for ongoing monitoring.

These initiatives is particularly important as it implies a unified planning across data, AI, infrastructure, and governance. Additionally, these recent developments contribute to positioning Côte d’Ivoire as a digital pioneer in West Africa. Furthermore, the focus of both strategies applies digital transformation equitably across sectors like agriculture, health, education.
