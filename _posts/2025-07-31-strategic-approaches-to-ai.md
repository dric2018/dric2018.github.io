### Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword; it represents a seismic shift with profound implications for every sector of our society. Contrary to popular belief, effective AI strategies are not merely about adopting advanced technology but also require meticulous preparation and careful implementation to ensure they achieve their intended goals. This blog post aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the insights gained from The World Bank Group (WBG)'s publication about `Devising a Strategic Approach to Artificial Intelligence` [1].

### üìç In a Nutshell

Not all countries need a national AI strategy. Nevertheless, every country should adopt strategic approaches to AI adoption within their borders. In fact:
- **The need for resources**: Any national AI strategy must be backed by significant financial, human, and technological resources support and guide stakeholders through development and implementation.
- **Strategic approach to AI**: This implies having a clear vision and roadmap for AI development and adoption.
- **Insights on published AI Strategies**: Less than `40% (up to 75) of the United Nations (UN) member states` have a published AI strategy [3]; from the African Union (AU) perspective, this translates to `over 21% of its member states` having such strategies in place, with at least 10 additional countries in the development process.

Generative AI (GenAI) has accelerated AI adoption, particularly in middle- and high-income countries, but low-income countries are still lagging behind. This disparity risks exacerbating the digital divide, furthering inequalities in access to information, jobs, and services.

### üìç Key Building Blocks of Effective National AI Strategies:
1. **AI Foundations (3 out of the 4 Cs)**
    - Connectivity: Reliable broadband and energy infrastructure.
    - Compute: High-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and data centers. 
    - Context-aware and digital data: Embedded with local knowledge and cutural sensitivity.
2. **AI Enablers**: 
    - Governance and Policy: Regulatory frameworks that support AI development.
    - Skills (Competencies): A skilled workforce with advanced profiles in STEM education. This is the fourth **C**.
    - Innovation Ecosystem: Encouraging innovation and collaboration among stakeholders.

3. **AI Use Cases/Services**: Sector-specific applications of AI.
4. **AI Builders and Users**: Identified stakeholders including private sector, public sector, academics, civil society, etc.

It should be noted that proper sequencing while assembling these building blocks is crucial to achieve the expected goals. However, in many developing economies, the `first and fourth blocks` are often overlooked, with more emphasis placed on the other components. This phenomenon can be attributed to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) attempting to leapfrog by leveraging their current assets to undertake what is feasible without following the same path as their predecessors. Nonetheless, it is crucial to emphasize that leapfrogging into AI must be meticulously prepared and planned to avoid potential pitfalls and unforeseen challenges in the future.


### üìç Common Characteristics of Countries Making Rapid AI Progress

Countries making rapid AI progress tend to share a common characteristic: robust `AI foundations` and at least one `enabler`.

### üìç A sense of Correlation
Themes less frequent in the published AI strategy mission and vision statements seem to be those that are more relevant to LMICs such as `Infrastructure`, `Data sovereignty`, `Public sector/Administration transformation`, `AI for public benefit`, `Skills training and Talent`.

### üìç Presence in Global Venues
Participation in global and regional AI forums help policymakers keep up to date about trends and international frameworks and best practices. It turns out that AI summits are for policymakers what AI conferences are for researchers and practionners.

### üìçMomentum and Strategic AI Adoption

Taking advantage of the momentum is critical for strategic AI adoption. Countries that fail to create a conducive environment for AI, especially LMICs for their youth, risk favoring mobility and brain drain of highly skilled individuals toward more attractive regions in the global north.

### üìç WBG Development Framework for Strategic Approach to AI
The handbook proposes a framework process for developing a strategic approach to AI, along with accompanying templates to help policymakers get up to speed on modules of interest.

### Conclusion
As the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, governments around the world are increasingly recognizing the urgent need to define their national strategies for harnessing this transformative technology. The ultimate goal is to leverage AI in ways that significantly benefit and uplift their populations. Simultaneously, there are active discussions on identifying and adopting best practices that ensure the effective development and deployment of AI applications across various priority sectors. The framework presented in this blog post was proposed by the World Bank Group (WBG) with a visionary approach‚Äîto empower policymakers with a suite of practical tools designed to develop strategic approaches to AI. This is not merely about defining overarching AI strategies that might not align with the unique needs and contexts of different countries, but rather about providing targeted, actionable solutions that can be tailored to each nation's specific requirements.
