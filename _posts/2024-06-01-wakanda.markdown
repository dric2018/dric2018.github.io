In Africa, practical applications of speech technologies are scarce, often limited to adjusting pre-existing models. This project aims to overcome language barriers and enhance communication by developing innovative solutions that foster global understanding and inclusion. Key goals include establishing a data repository for several African languages, and developing speech and language models talored for local use cases.
